0- png and jpeg support up to "24 bits" 16 million colors,bmp support up to "32 bits" 4 billion colors,Gifs support up to "8 bits" 256 colors
1. Gifs support animation
2. lossy compression loses data from the original lossless compression restors all the data from compression
3. Jpegs are lossy compressed
4. deleting a file mean rewriting the metadata that pinted to the file
5. is someone needs to delete data with high probability of not being recovered he can use sanitization tool which usually overwrites it 
6. stdint is library that orovides "typedef"
7. they data types that assign which data you want to use and every data type has it's own specific //value
8. BYTE has is one byte - DWORD is 4 bytes - LONG is 4 byes - WORD is 2 bytes
9. character 'B' and 'M'
10. bisize is number of bytes of image and bfsize is the size of the whole file
11. bihieght is negative means its a top down DIB with origin of upper left corner
12. RGBTRIBLE
13. if the file isn't created
14. because we want to read the sizeof only once
15. padding will equal 3
16. move pointer to another location in file
17. argument in fseek..current position of file pointer
